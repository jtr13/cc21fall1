## Introduction
My CC work is about how to use neo4j to visualize graph data. I have uploaded my video tutorial to canvas. The github link above contains a cheat sheet of GraphQL which is a Graph database query language like SQL that enables you to play with graph data and generate flexible visualizations in neo4j.
