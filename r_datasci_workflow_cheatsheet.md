# R Data Science Workflow CheatSheet

Kailande Cassamajor and Victoria Edwards

We created a cheat sheet for data science students like ourselves. We 
decided on this idea because we felt a simple reference page that 
explains the workflow of a typical project would be handy. The first 
page of this cheat sheet shows the flow of a typical data science 
project. Each step of the workflow includes the libraries used and a 
brief description of what each library does. To access more details 
about a specific library (most common/useful functions and resource 
links), click on a library name. Creating this cheat sheet gave us a better 
understanding of the workflow for a data science project in r and 
clarified the purpose for each of the libraries (most of which we have 
been using in class). Another iteration of this project would include 
aesthetic improvements.
